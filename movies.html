    <h3>Director: James Cameron</h3>

    <p>In the 22nd century, Earth's Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines for the valuable mineral unobtanium
      on the moon Pandora. The Na'vi, blue-skinned humanoids, inhabit Pandora, living in harmony with nature. Humans
      explore Pandora through "avatars," Na'vi-human hybrids. Paralyzed Marine Jake Sully takes over his deceased twin's
      avatar mission. He meets Neytiri, a Na'vi female, who introduces him to her tribe. RDA's Colonel Quaritch promises
      Jake his legs back if he gathers intel for an upcoming invasion. As Jake bonds with the Na'vi, he faces a moral
      choice. Tensions escalate, leading to a battle between humans and the Na'vi. Jake decides to side with the Na'vi
      against RDA's exploitative plans. The film emphasizes themes of nature, industrialism, and spiritual connection.
